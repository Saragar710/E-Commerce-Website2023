# E-Commerce-Website2023

## Destciption
This app, using backend technology is useful to people who buy and sell products online. I chose to use all apparel. One member of my family is extreamly picky when it comes to their shoes. Another family member is all about hoodies! She has at least 7 different colors and brands of hoodies. While another family member is into fashion and accesories. She has a few options of purses and a plethora of clothing. So this app could really benifit me. With so much to do everyday, sometimes it is hard to go to specific stores or run to the mall. So the future is online shopping. It is very convienent.

## Installation
The app has all the dependencies needed. Simply run npm start and it will load.
